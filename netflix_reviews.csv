Its a great alternative but now since they are getting close to the same price to get the main streaming apps compared to cable it just doesnt feel worth it anymore like dang everything else is expensive we know you are paying low amounts for server space to user count stop the price raising.

It tells you you need to update when u don't. Also why do I have to have the app to watch it on my phone instead of just using browser? Maybe because they're forcing people to download to please their investors? Trash. I can see now why people steal content on pirate bay. At least u can watch it anywhere,1,1,8.50.0 build 9 50318,2024-06-03 07:58:17,8.50.0 build 9 50318

That other languages are there except for ours. Nowadays everywhere we can see equality. But not in launguages and caste. I hate to say this but u wanna u social media to run successfully for a long term. Try giving importance to all the launguages and their culture. I can see our launguage movie dubbed to other launguages. But not seen in our launguage. Highly disappointed.,1,0,8.115.2 build 6 50688,2024-05-31 05:56:06,8.115.2 build 6 50688

Netflix is the only streaming I have problems with. my family pays 100% of the Netflix bill. I expect 100% service 100% of the time. not only 100% on non peak hours and maybe 45% on peak hours. should be a law past if you can't give 100% of what customers pay for you shouldn't be able to add anymore customers.,3,0,8.116.0 build 8 50690,2024-05-31 03:21:58,8.116.0 build 8 50690

Today the payment is due and unlike the other apps it has immediately cut us off because of payment. Up until today we had always had time to pay and keep enjoying the app. You guys are extremely greedy.

While watching on TV You start watching some movie of 2 hours after few minutes or an hour it will go blank. Even the whole page goes blank. It's not something happening first time... Every time and everyday it's same whatever you try. No option to report this at the app only. ALL THIS WHILE PLAYING ON ONE SCREEN ONLY.

It was $19.99 2 years ago, and now it's $22.99. If they had live TV with a DVR, I would have jumped right on it right away. I'm surprised they haven't yet. There's a lot of money with live TV, including movies. Something like YouTube TV streaming, and it comes with a DVR in the app. Pick any TV and movies of your liking.

But I decided to give it another go only to find that there's not a cast button for some reason!! The only use I would have for this streaming service is to cast it to the TV so now it's just pointless and still expensive. I tried all the suggested trouble shooting steps but nothing is making casting possible. Cancelling AGAIN.,1,36,8.109.0 build 7 50647,2024-04-02 02:11:06,8.109.0 build 7 50647
